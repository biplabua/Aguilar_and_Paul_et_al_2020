Observed 4369220 total fragments (4369220 in most recent round)

[2019-11-01 17:52:50.989] [jointLog] [info] Computed 14190 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-11-01 17:52:50.989] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2934394 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-11-01 17:52:50.992] [jointLog] [warning] 0.643891% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2019-11-01 17:52:50.992] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2934394 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
