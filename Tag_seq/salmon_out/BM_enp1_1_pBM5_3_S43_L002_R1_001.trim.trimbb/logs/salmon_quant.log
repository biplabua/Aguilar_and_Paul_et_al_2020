[2019-11-01 17:54:55.083] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2479676 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-11-01 17:54:55.086] [jointLog] [warning] 1.22224% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2019-11-01 17:54:55.087] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2479676 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
