[2019-11-01 17:53:57.865] [jointLog] [warning] 0.732839% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2019-11-01 17:53:57.865] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3131504 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
