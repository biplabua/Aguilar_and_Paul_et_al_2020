Observed 4940447 total fragments (4940447 in most recent round)

[2019-11-01 17:53:46.314] [jointLog] [info] Computed 15762 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-11-01 17:53:46.314] [jointLog] [info] Counted 3375230 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-11-01 17:53:46.317] [jointLog] [warning] 0.859679% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.


[2019-11-01 17:53:46.317] [jointLog] [warning] Only 3375230 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
